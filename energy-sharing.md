# Energy Sharing

## Three-Step Vision

### Step 1: Quest Game (Current)
- NFT collection and trading
- Community building
- Token creation and management

### Step 2: Real Life Game (Near-term)
- **Manual energy trading** between users
- **Trust-based exchanges** via mobile app
- **Physical energy transfer** (car-to-car, battery exchange)
- **QR code scanning** for energy transactions
- **Gray area navigation** - energy trading regulations

### Step 3: Network Energy Sharing (2027+)
- **Cross-network Energy Sharing** via Smart-Meter and Micro-Smart-Meter
- **Automated smart meter integration**
- **Smart Contract** implementation for grid-level trading
- **Tamper-proof** blockchain records
- **Full decentralized energy market**

## Current Energy Trading Mechanisms
- **Smart meter integration** (future)
- **Micro smart meter** technology
- **Car-to-car energy transfer** capability
- **Citizen energy concepts** and energy sharing initiatives
- **Manual tracking** (current implementation due to limited smart meter availability)
- **EU regulatory support** for energy sharing concepts
