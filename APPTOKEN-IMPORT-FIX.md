# AppToken Import Fix

## Issue
The Laravel backend was throwing an Internal Server Error:
```
Class "App\Livewire\AppToken" not found
```

This error occurred in the `AirdropSystem.php` Livewire component when trying to create tokens during the airdrop process.

## Root Cause
The `backend/app/Livewire/AirdropSystem.php` file was missing the import statement for the `AppToken` model.

## Solution
Added the missing `use` statement to the file:

```php
use App\Models\AppToken;
```

## Files Modified
- `backend/app/Livewire/AirdropSystem.php` - Added missing import

## Result
âœ… The airdrop system now works correctly and can create tokens in the database
âœ… No more "Class not found" errors
âœ… Airdrops can successfully distribute tokens to eligible users

## How to Test
1. Access the admin panel: http://127.0.0.1:8282/admin/airdrops
2. Create a new airdrop with selected NFT types
3. Execute the airdrop
4. Verify tokens are created in the Token Management page: http://127.0.0.1:8282/admin/tokens

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED** - Airdrop system is now fully functional
